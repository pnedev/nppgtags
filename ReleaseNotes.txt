What's new in v4.2.1
=======================

What's new in v4.0.0
=======================

- Made configuration per database.
    This adds another file to the database ones (GTAGS, etc.) - NppGTags.cfg.
    The good thing is that each database can now be tuned separately from all the others - has its own defined
    libraries and parser. The auto-update database feature won't be corrupting the database anymore in case the
    database is created with one parser that is lately changed in the global settings.

- Add 'Search in Other Files' command that will perform literal or regexp searches in text files, Makefiles or any
    other text files that are not recognized as sources by the parser during database creation

- Auto-update database feature will now update all databases that have indexed the changed file
- Add 'Update Library DBs' control in Settings window to easily update all project's libraries
- Auto-complete now provides completion suggestions not for the whole word under the cursor but for the string from
    the beginning of the word to the cursor position

- Code re-factored for improved stability and speed
- Use STL containers instead of custom ones
- Use single UI thread and dedicated command threads.
    This provides better UI experience, responsiveness and improved speed

- Update Activity windows position when necessary for better user experience
- Various tweaks, improvements and bug-fixes
- About window now reports also the Ctags binary version

- Update GTAGS binaries to v6.5.2
- Use the new feature of v6.5.2 to ignore non parse-able files while creating native database
    (using the default parser). This does not abort database creation anymore


What's new in v3.1.0
=======================

- Improve search window auto-complete feature
- Improve auto-complete speed
- Fix issue with configurations when read from the config file


What's new in v3.0.0
=======================

- Add plugin config

- The user can now select the code parser to be used - the default GTags, Ctags or Pygments
    (needs external Pygments Python package to be installed that is not provided with the plugin).
    Changing the parser will require database re-creation (to re-parse the code with the new parser).
    GTags parser supports C, C++, Java and several other languages. Ctags parser supports considerably more
    languages but doesn't support reference search. Pygments supports a lot of languages + reference search
    but requires external Python package. Database creation is also slower

- The user can now create and set library databases to be used together with the project DB -
    library DBs are used only for definition searches and auto-completion

- Major UI and code rework

- The user can now set the search options (case sensitivity and regexp) through the search window together with
    the string to search. Not all search commands support regexp. If the search window is not used the search
    is case sensitive and literal (no regexp) by default

- The search window provides auto-complete feature on the second char typed. Drop-down completion list will
    appear based on the text entered. On very large projects the auto-completion might take a while to finish

- Results window automatically wraps long result lines so no horizontal scrolling is necessary

- Results window is now fully controllable through the keyboard - Left and Right arrow keys switch between tabs,
    ESC key closes the active tab. Up and Down arrow keys move through results one at a time while Page-Up and
    Page-Down jump over whole screen of results. ENTER key now also opens result location or toggles fold
    (same as SPACE)

- Results window style now more closely resembles Notepad++ theme. Use more neutral colors that look better on
    both light and dark themes

- Add plugin command to toggle focus between results window and Notepad++ document. The user can assign
    shortcut key to this command through Notepad++ Shortcut Mapper to be able to switch focus easily

- Add Go Forward plugin command to be able to 'undo' recent Go Back action

- Unite Find Literal and Grep in a single Search command. The search is literal by default - the user can issue
    regexp search through the search window options

- AutoComplete File now shows only valid filenames and paths, not partial ones

- Auto Update database is now triggered on file rename and file delete also. This feature uses new Notepad++
    notifications available since v6.7.5

- Fix several bugs regarding database locking/unlocking

- Error messages made more informative where possible

- Numerous optimizations and fixes

- Update GTags binaries to v6.5


What's new in v2.3.0
=======================

- Set fore, back and line colors from the selected Notepad++ theme

- Make folding view more appealing
- Make search word in the result click-able as a link to ease code navigation
- Change cursor to reflect its position and the tab switch action
- Highlight all search word occurrences in a single line


What's new in v2.1.0
=======================

- Show search type in results window tab name
- Remember and restore folded state on tab switch
- Clicking anywhere in expanded fold margin now collapses it (it is no longer necessary to click exactly [-] to collapse)
- Header info is no longer fold-able
- Tab name font is "Tahoma" and the font size is results font size - 1
- Colorize search results line numbers for better viewing
- Colorize and open regexp (GREP) search results correctly
- Various fixes
- Update GTags binaries to v6.3.4. This is a bug fix release


What's new in v2.0.2
=======================

- Remove the last empty line from the ScintillaUI window

- New DocLocation entry added only if the last one is not the same
- Activity window show delay is handled better
